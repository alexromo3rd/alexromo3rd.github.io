Around four years ago I was starting my seventh at the same company and I was feeling stuck. I had moved up quite a bit over those seven years but I hit a wall and knew I wouldn't be able to rise any higher, although at that point I wasn't sure I wanted to. 

I took this job initially because I wanted something that was full time, Monday through Friday, and had benefits. I never planned on staying long term, however as I previously mentioned I've now been in the field for many years (11 now to be exact). I've worked hard in order to move up and make more money to support my wife and doggos. I've always been a hard worker and am always looking for the next step. I'm not one to be complacent. 

Back to why I chose Software Development. I started working through basic Codecademy and Team Treehouse tutorials and I was hooked! Once I discovered Ruby it was all over...I was never going to enjoy anything as much as I enjoy programming in Ruby. I decided to stop attending community college and focus all of my effort on learning to program to change careers. 

I have worked on and completed countless tuturials and courses however I never seemed to progress past a certiain point. I blame myself for always starting over at the beginning whenever I took any time off of coding. I also spend too many months/years hopping between whatever was popular to learn at the moment. Enough is enough.

I enrolled at Flatiron School so that I can focus on doing what I love, programming in Ruby, and also to have a strict path to follow in order to be successful as a programmer. I love coding, I love problem solving, and I hope one day I'll be able to do it for a living!
